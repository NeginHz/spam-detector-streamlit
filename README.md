#  Spam Detector - Streamlit App

A lightweight and accurate **spam detection web app** powered by **Scikit-learn**, **Streamlit**, and a well-evaluated **SVM model (SVM-2)**.

>  Developed as part of an **NLP course Project** on text classification using machine learning.  
>  The selected model demonstrated the best generalization across multiple datasets after extensive evaluation.

##  About the Project

This app takes a **text message** as input and classifies it as either:

- `HAM` (Not Spam)  
- `SPAM` (Unwanted or Junk Message)

The backend model is a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** trained on real-world SMS messages.  
It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to extract meaningful features from text for spam detection.

## Model Selection Process

This project includes a **3-phase model evaluation pipeline** implemented in Jupyter/Colab notebooks:

📂 `notebooks/`

-  **Notebook 1 (Path 1)**  
  Trains NB-1 and SVM-1 using the **Small Dataset**. Evaluated on validation/test and general unseen data.

-  **Notebook 2 (Path 2)**  
  Trains NB-2 and SVM-2 using a **large Kaggle dataset**.. Shows improved performance across test datasets.

-  **Notebook 3 (Cross Evaluation)**  
  Compares all 4 models across 4 datasets.  
   **SVM-2** was selected as the final model based on best F1 score and stable performance across validation, test, and unseen data.

  ## Dataset Information

- **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** (Kaggle) 
- **Small Dataset** (from GitHub by justmarkham)

## Why Streamlit?

Streamlit is used to quickly turn the final trained model into a usable web app:

-  Simple input box for message  
-  Predicts whether message is spam or ham  
-  Uses saved `SVM-2` model and `TF-IDF` vectorizer (`joblib`)

---

## Used Google Colab

All preprocessing, training, and evaluation were performed in **Google Colab** for easy scalability and reproducibility.  
Notebooks were saved and exported from Colab into the project.
